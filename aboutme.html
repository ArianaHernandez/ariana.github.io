        <p>Im currently doing college classes with LIU and Medgar Evars. I'm also a Student Ambassador, and doing Advanced ScriptEd classes. I also own my own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theknitgarden/">business</a> </p>
        <h2>Future </h2>
        <p> As much as I love coding, my real passion is animals. I would like to become a veterinarian. I want to work at a clinic for several years, before opening up my own Wildlife Rescue Conservation.
