        <h2>Past</h2>
        <p>I am a good scholar and have been Valedictorian twice. I took Software Engineering (year one and two). </p>
        <h2>Present</h2>
        <p>Im currently doing college classes with LIU and Medgar Evars. I'm also a Student Ambassador, and doing Advanced CodeNation classes. I also own my own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theknitgarden/">business</a> </p>
        <h2>Future </h2>
        <p> As much as I love coding, my real passion is animals. I would like to become a veterinarian. I want to work at a clinic for several years, before opening up my own Wildlife Rescue Conservation.
        Knowing programming will be a good asset to being able to run a company.
